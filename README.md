# What is SudokuBase?
SudokuBase is an online platform for playing sudoku. 

# How does Sudokubase work?
SudokuBase uses a Sudoku engine (SudoGen, still a private project but will soon be available as open source).
At regular intervals, the Sudoku generator produces new puzzles and those are stored in the database, along with further
puzzle information and user solving statistics.

# What technologies are in play? 
The SudokuBase backend is based on the Spring Framework. Further technologies used for this project are 
MySQL, jQuery and of course the holy trinity: HTML, CSS and JS. Deployment is done
on Heroku and mail service is provided by SendGrid

# What is the goal?
The goal is to create a free platform for sudoku-fans, providing unlimited puzzles for different levels
and additional features like a knowledge base, various training methods, competitive play, chat and various 
gamification features like rating, archievements and badges.
